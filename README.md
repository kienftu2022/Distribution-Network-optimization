# Distribution-Network-optimization
LOGage is a leading national supplier of Plumbing and Mechanical Products with the vast network of up to 635 branches nationwide. Currently, relying on a single centralized DC is costly in terms of transportation and expose inventory to significant risk as well. Therefore, redesigning the network with numerous sub DCs is ideal to handle this issue.
Step 1: We evaluate the current inventory and transportation cost of the centralized distribution network.
Step 2: Using K-mean, , Agglomerative Clustering, and Voronoi Clustering to find how many sub DCs is optimal for saving cost with the Travelling Saleman transportation method. Considering truck's capacity, customer's time restriction, service level agreement and the CO2 emission amount released.
Step 3: Calculate the specific cost and calculate other different scenarios for verification.
